# Problem 6 https://projecteuler.net/problem=6
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 12+22+...+102=385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1+2+...+10)2=552=3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

n = 100
numbers2 = [i**2 for i  in range(1,n+1)]
numbers = [i for i in range(1, n+1 )]

result = sum(numbers)**2 - sum(numbers2)
